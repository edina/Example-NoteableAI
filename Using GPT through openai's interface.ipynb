    "The latest Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT/GPT3/GPT4) are trained on a very large corpus of text and a lot of reinforcement learning to tune their output. To access them therefore we have to make calls to servers run by the teams that have developed and trained them (OpenAI in this case for ChatGPT models). More typically most of us have trialled that out by typing text into their webpage in a prompt, but here we will do that using a python programming interface making calls to the machinery that sits behind the scenes powering that web interface.\n",

We will also import one called `json` which deals with a type of file called json files - these are the types of files that are passed to and from the the server at OpenAi containing our prompt text and the results back from it. We will have need to pick those apart to get our reponse text, so we need that module here too.\n",
